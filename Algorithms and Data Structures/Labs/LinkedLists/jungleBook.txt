It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and
spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in
their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four
tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave
where they all lived. "Augrh!" said Father Wolf. "It is time to hunt again."
He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail
crossed the threshold and whined: "Good luck go with you, O Chief of the
Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that
they may never forget the hungry in this world."
